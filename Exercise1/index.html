		The text on my webpage is the real story of Little <b><u>Red Riding Hood</u></b> from the <b><i>wolf's</i></b> point to view.  He is not the guy everyone thinks he is.  The 3 Little Pigs were thier own worst ennemy.  He wasn't blowing on houses.  He just had a terrible, terrible cold.
		<div>The first time he sneezed was on the house of straw.</div>  There was no way that house could survive.  
		<div>The second house was made of sticks and held up a BinaryTreettle longer.</div>  It was the oldest pig brother who had the brains.  He blilt his house of bricks.
